This script calculates free energy perturbation (FEP) corrections 
to a free energy surface from Metadynamics simulation (MetaD) 
along a collective variable (CV) using a weighted histogram accounting 
for the potential energy difference between two reference Hamiltonians.

HOWTO

1) Run a MetaD simulation using a low-level potential (U_LL), e.g. semiepirical or DFTB and reach convergence

2) Remove first transitent from the simulation 

3) Extract a selected number of configurations from the original trajectory

4) Calculate the energy only of these configurations using a high-level potential (U_HL)
 
5) Prepare a new COLVAR file with the following columns
   ____________________________________________________
   Time       CV      metad.rbias      U_LL     U_HL
   ...
   ...
   ____________________________________________________
  
   Make sure that COLVAR is aligned, i.e. each CV, bias, U_LL, and U_HL 
   correspond to the same structure

6) Run metaFEP_histo_rew.py

7) This will produce the file MetaFEP.dat containing the FEP free energy along 
   the CV smoothed using a moving average filter and relative 95% confidence 
   lower and upper bounds. Raw FEP data also available in last column (noisy)
